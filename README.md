zineTemplate
==================

## A simple template for use in paginating a 31 page 8 1/2 x 11 folded zine, especially a comic.


# INTRODUCTION: 

This is a 31 page zine template made for the comic Harold the Bird, but making it available since I had a hard time finding this information anywhere. Enjoy.
